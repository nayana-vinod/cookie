<h4>🌟Our Idea🌟</h4>
  <p>The world is going through a tough time. To fight this battle against the novel coronavirus, each and everyone must stay healthy, not just physically but both mentally and emotionally. Mental Health is an untouched topic which we think, should be given higher importance, especially during these dire situations and mundane circumstances. According to the United Nations, depression is ranked third in the global burden of disease and is projected to rank first in 2030. In the Post-COVID world, mental health is going to become a grave issue, and hence we would like to address it as early as possible.</p>
